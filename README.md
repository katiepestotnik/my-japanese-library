Application that allows a user to signup and login to create their own Japanese word library.<br>
Currently, user has full CRUD functionality for nouns, verbs, and adjectives.<br><br>
User can use a translation API call on the central hub page.<br>
    - Free API not great with exact translations. Translates a lot of words into katakana while there should be a hiragana or kanji version.<br><br>
Future Enhancements<br>
    - Favicon<br>
    - Show page will have a special symbol displayed if word is marked as memorized.<br>
    - Have the word read aloud from computer speaker as soon as show page loads.<br>
