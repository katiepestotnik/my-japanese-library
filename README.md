# My Japanese Library

### Link to live site: [日本後の図書館](https://my-japanese-library.herokuapp.com/)

Application that allows a user to signup and login to create their own Japanese word library.<br>
Currently, user has full CRUD functionality for nouns, verbs, and adjectives.<br><br>
User can use a translation API call on the central hub page.<br>
    - Free API not great with exact translations. Translates a lot of words into katakana while there should be a hiragana or kanji version.<br><br>
Future Enhancements<br>
    - Have the word read aloud from computer speaker as soon as show page loads.
